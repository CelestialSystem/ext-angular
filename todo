 Issues - athakur
  - we need to specify size in root element of each example else it does not show up. This will break on different screen sizes.
  - toolbar tag does not work inside grid tag (Eg. ReconfigureGrid & StockTicker)
  - titleBar property does not exist for Grid (Eg. Big Data)
  - widgetcell tag not working. (And plugins for that matter) [Eg. Big Data & Render Cell in components]
  - render method does not parse the HTML code but uses as string [See multiple grid examples]
  - textcolumn/numbercolumn tag not working under columnd tag  [See Big Data example]
  - Tree widgets not loading with error ERROR Error: [Ext.create] Unrecognized class name / alias: widget.tree
  - Redux grid is not rendering (We are not using redux as well. Needs review)
  - Button and split button menu always shows up ([hidden] attribute does not work as well as *ngif).
  - DragResizeValidation calendar example does not restrict dragging and resizing
  - animate not a property of polar (See Basic Gauge under charts)
  - child not handled (See Basic Gauge/Box Plot under charts)

Issues - Alisha
  - hbox and vbox Layout components having UI issue that initial 3 conatiners/panels are not visible though in dom.
  - For each component i have to explicitly set the width and height! I think this would break on different systems.
  It will break once code window in merged.
  - ResizableLayoutComponent have multiple UI issues. (to reproduce compare from ext-react). Can demo this in next call. 
  - CardLayoutComponent using *ngFor is not working.
  - Text in the whole app is center aligned. do i need to handle this separately to make it look like ext-React? 
   Or probably a solution to set text-align to be 'left' for all components ?  @Marc please help me how to handle this.
  - Draw Component does not seems to have these methods: mpuseup,mpusedown etc. - Revisit this.
  - UI for SearchField, Validation is breaking.
  - RadioField on chnaging is giving error - Look into this.

  One solved::
  - FileField have a div showing uploaded file name is missing because of *ngIf not working. - WORKED with hidden property.
  - Items in Carousel not rendering. - Solved via adding height and width.
  - FormPanel (ext component) does not have reset() event binded to it. This might be because in ext component it is
  inherited from Ext.Field.Manager -- solved i was doing something wrong in setting the refrence.
