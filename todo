 Issues - athakur
  - we need to specify size in root element of each example else it does not show up. This will break on different screen sizes. [Need to see in react]
  - [Aniket] render method does not parse the HTML code but uses as string [See multiple grid examples] [isolate to standalone angular app] 
  - [Aniket/Marc] Tree widgets not loading with error ERROR Error: [Ext.create] Unrecognized class name / alias: widget.tree [revisit - Marc & Aniket]
  - [Aniket] DragResizeValidation calendar example does not restrict dragging and resizing [Issue - working in react but not in angular, use extjs format]
  - [Aniket] widgetcell tag not working. (And plugins for that matter) [Eg. Big Data & Render Cell in components] [Visit RendererCell like in react/ Need a simple example in extjs]

Marc
  - [Marc] For each component i have to explicitly set the width and height! I think this would break on different systems. - still true??
  - [Marc] ResizableLayoutComponent have multiple UI issues. (to reproduce compare from ext-react). Can demo this in next call. 
  - [Marc] UI for SearchField is breaking. - which example??
  - [Marc] In Drag Drop text does not change when draging. (check Proxy and Handles)

Marc - Completed
  - [Marc] toolbar tag does not work inside grid tag (Eg. ReconfigureGrid & StockTicker) [Retest] [Fixed base.tpl but the order is not correct]
  - [Marc] class defined within a component is not getting applied. So, HOW DO WE APPLY CSS CLASSES ?
  - [Marc] hbox and vbox Layout components, Validation (within Forms) having UI issue that initial 3 conatiners/panels are not visible though in dom.
  - [Marc] Text in the whole app is center aligned. do i need to handle this separately to make it look like ext-React? 
  - [Marc] titleBar property does not exist for Grid (Eg. Big Data) [change in SDK - done]

Issues - Alisha
  - [Alisha] CardLayoutComponent using *ngFor is not working. - can revisit.
  
Issues - Tommy
  - ExtAngular components that use Angular structural directives (e.g. ngFor, ngIf) do not dynamically update when their bound data changes.  This is preventing the following from working as desired:
    - Code Preview (you muist reload the page to see the correct code preview panels).
  - Code Preview
    - FAB button is not positioned properly.
    - Does not re-render as you navigate due to Angular structural directives issue mentioned above.
    - CSS for syntax highlighting is hard coded in index.html because it wasn't loading when specified in the component's styleUrls. - see ext-angular-demo

Done
  - animate not a property of polar (See Basic Gauge under charts) [Use animation/ Fix in react as well] - Done
  - [Marc] child not handled (See Basic Gauge/Box Plot under charts) [Known issue] [Take a pull and test]
  - Redux grid is not rendering (We are not using redux as well. Needs review) [Get rid of this. More of react thing] - No action
  - textcolumn/numbercolumn tag not working under columnd tag  [See Big Data example] = done/revisit - Done
  - FileField have a div showing uploaded file name is missing because of *ngIf not working. - WORKED with hidden property.
  - Items in Carousel not rendering. - Solved via adding height and width.
  - FormPanel (ext component) does not have reset() event binded to it. This might be because in ext component it is
    inherited from Ext.Field.Manager -- solved i was doing something wrong in setting the refrence.
  - Draw Component does not seems to have these methods: mpuseup,mpusedown - solved via setting these in the ref stored in ready func.

Low priority
  - [Aniket] Button and split button menu always shows up ([hidden] attribute does not work as well as *ngif). [use setMenu method/zip and project to Marc] - Done/Revisit angular way
