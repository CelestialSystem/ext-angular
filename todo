Issues
 - kitchensink
    - breadcrumb background color
    - code window does not reflect current example (dependent on ngFor - line 19)
    - core.js:15707 Navigation triggered outside Angular zone, did you forget to call 'ngZone.run()'?
    
 - [To Be Discussed] ext-angular-gen 
    - need to remove Angular CLI requirement
    - need to remove react-only questions
 - tree-shaking 
    - [Alisha] in plugin: tree shake the typescript ExtAngular files
    - test against ext-angular-gen (once CLI dependency is removed)
 - [TBD] package ext-angular.service (both service and intermediate component (app))
   - clean up and document bootstrapping process
 - [Marc] widgetcell tag not working. (And plugins for that matter) [Eg. Big Data & Render Cell in components] [Visit RendererCell like in react/ Need a simple example in extjs]
 - [Marc] ExtAngular components that use Angular structural directives (e.g. ngFor, ngIf) do not dynamically update when their bound data changes.  This is preventing the following from working as desired - Code Preview (you muist reload the page to see the correct code preview panels).
 - [Marc] resources from packages like ux are not property referenced [Components -> Color Picker -> Basic]

  - [Aniket] UI for SearchField is breaking. Search form is not docked right. 
 (Form fields - Eg( All>Components>Forms>Searchfield or ALl->Components>TitleBar) - PUT up a simple example
      -> This has been fixed temporarily. Both above components are fixed. For permanent fix need to add align in button and searchfield components (or common parent?)

Issues (faced by Alisha) in api-docs examples: 
- angular/api-docs/modern/modern/src/grid/plugin have CellEditing and Editable defines selectfield 
as one of the columns of grid but on editing that column selectfield is not rendered.

Fixed
 - (major) orgchart component does not exists (Under pivot/hierearchy) [External component addition].  
 - Tree shaking in plugin: create manifest.js to allow Sencha Cmd to create ExtJS ext.js and ext.css files
 - width should not be needed, only height at this point (until we figure out height issue)
 - remove Redux Grid from examples
 -  [Marc] colorpicker needs type library (rerun doxi)
 - stars on premium components
 - breadcrumb has extra character at end - DONE
 - (major) render method does not parse the HTML code but uses as string [See multiple grid examples] [isolate to standalone angular app] 
 - we need to specify size in root element of each example else it does not show up. This will break on different screen sizes. [Add examples]
 - TouchEvents: Events list is not updated (using *ngFor rendering)
 - In Drag Drop text does not change when draging. (check Proxy and Handles). Files Drag Drop not working for same reason as UI is not updated. 
 - ResizableHandle in Panels:Unable to resize the panel from corners and dynamic option not working 
 - ResizableLayoutComponent have multiple UI issues. (to reproduce compare from ext-react). Can demo this in next call. 
 - Hierarchy D3: In ZoomableSunburst selectionChange() used in react but unable to find an equivalent here.
  so zooming not working on selection of chart node.
 - FAB button is not positioned properly.
 - CSS for syntax highlighting is hard coded in index.html because it wasn't loading when specified in the component's styleUrls. - see ext-angular-demo
 - (major) Tabs: All components are not rendering. Error: Adding a card to a tab container without specifying any tab configuration
 - (major) Tree widgets not loading with error ERROR Error: [Ext.create] Unrecognized class name / alias: widget.tree [Need to revisit D3 tree] 
 - (major) Tree widgets not loading with error ERROR Error: [Ext.create] Unrecognized class name / alias: widget.tree [Fixed/Need to revisit D3 tree] 
 - [Aniket] Button and split button menu always shows up ([hidden] attribute does not work as well as *ngif). [use setMenu method/zip and project to Marc] - Done/Revisit angular way (Low priority)

  - [Aniket] DragResizeValidation calendar example does not restrict dragging and resizing - Put a simple example 


ExtAngular
 - use ExtJS 6.7
 - modern kitchensink
 - modern Sencha Tests
 - modern docs
 - ext-angular-gen
 - package ext-angular.service
 - clean up bootstrapping process
 - ExtAngular functionality
   - using *ngIf (etc) in an ExtAngular component
   - conflict with button class
 - plugin tree-shaking (for ExtJS ext.js and ext.css)
 - tree shake the typescript ExtAngular files
 - clean doxi output
 - use type info for properties in ts ExtAngular files - future scope
