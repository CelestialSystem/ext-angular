>>>Remaining components<<<
RendererCell not working. No data
Unable to find level of child div in parent for CreateChild Element Components
RelEditor - value 1 not showing in ui due to numberfield including 6-7 levels of parent divs.

A) Due to ngIf not working, so wherever test for existence was to be made, a test for visibility is made
ReplaceWithMarkup : instead of destroyed, checking for hidden
RelArrayDelete - check that only one child is visible and other two are hidden instead of checking that only one child exists

B) Functions not working
RelDialog - getButtons returns null
RelGridColumn - SparkLine giving some ui issue and with #sparLine, test not passing
RendererCell, TemplateUnmount, LifecycleUnmount, CreateChild, Events  - .text() or .texLike() does not work with element

C) Component Not found
RendererCell - renderCell not found

D) Test case unclear
Renderwhenready - what to write as test for angular? It gets rendered initially only.

E) Test case Manipulated
HTML - no class known to check in which div is rendered like in React. So, checked for existence of div inside container
TemplateList, TemplateGrid - could not fetch element using id directly, thus used parent reference
In RelUpdate, first we need to toggle menu seperately then Toggle button works in ui.
